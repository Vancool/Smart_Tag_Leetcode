I write algorithm questions everyday for fun. 

One day I just think:

Why I don't create a repo to review and sort the questions? 

Emmm... 🤔but I don't want to store a dictionary for algorithm on my own blog. That's the reason why I create this repo and record something. 

So...😏

`leetcode.sort()`
